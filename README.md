# Drata-0.1
It's a simple game made with python and pygame where you have to dodge the obstacles. It also has pause functionality.

Read before you run:
  1. The associated files like icons, image and music files should be same directory as main python file while running the game.
  2. Modules that this game uses: pygame, time, random.
  3. Code is associated with comments for sake of simplicity.
  4. Some of the stuff in game is hardcoded, so any help in improving that would be appreciated.
